AsC - Infrastructure as code

Dynamic component manager/loader inspired by OSGi. 
From small to large, a configuration describes which
components the target app or system needs to run.  
An execution plan will be run to create the described infrastructure.

1) build a defined infrastructure by code
2) build a dynamic infrastructure depending on the environment or target (device)

Works together with 'dynlayers'.
